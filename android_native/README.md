## 📈 Health Calculations

### Cancer Risk Assessment
The app calculates relative cancer risk based on daily cigarette consumption:
- 1 cigarette/day: 2.18x risk
- 10 cigarettes/day: 3.59x risk
- 15 cigarettes/day: 4.70x risk
- 20 cigarettes/day: 5.87x risk
- 30 cigarettes/day: 5.95x risk
- 40 cigarettes/day: 7.17x risk
- 50+ cigarettes/day: 15.07x risk

### Brinkman Index
Health risk assessment based on the formula: `Daily cigarettes × Years of smoking`
- < 400: Not serious
- 400-499: Little danger
- 500-599: Low danger
- 600-999: Danger
- 1000-1199: High danger
- ≥ 1200: Extreme danger
